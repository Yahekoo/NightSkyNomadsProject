# Night Sky Nomads

Our project is a website committed to disseminating knowledge through effective IT tools, creating an engaging, educational, and interactive experience for young individuals. It comprises dedicated sections for both kids and young learners, providing opportunities to enhance their knowledge in an enjoyable manner. The platform delves into the intricacies of eclipses, covering topics such as eclipse seasons, the mechanics behind eclipses, and the reasons why only certain people on Earth can observe an eclipse at any given time...This understanding is facilitated through visualizations of the corona and other celestial components

The journey begins with general information and progresses to include interactive games and multi-perspective simulations. These simulations take into account various factors such as distances, the solar system, and offer users the choice of perspectives, allowing them to position themselves on Earth, the Moon, or any other planet in the solar system. 

Our project is a sum of videos made by the team, a game taking the form of a quiz for evaluation, and a multi-perspective simulation. Our Idea aimed to create a metaverse for eclipse visualization by having the opportunity to showcase the eclipse calendar, in the past, the present, and the future.

**a- Rising safety awareness:**

Glasses are important to view eclipses, as they should be in a good state (Details explained on the website) 

**b- Informing about Eclipses:**

We have tried to answer the questions related to Eclipses through videos made by the team to make the learning process more fun and simple.

You can see the avatar of our team member Chaymae among with the rest of members Chorouk, Hassan, Mohamed, and Redouan explaining issues and series of questions related to Eclipses. 

You can also view the eclipse calendar, in the past, the present, and the furure, to have a sense of time-traveling.

Our vision was to go from 2017 to 2030, simulating lunar eclipses, using NASA Website resources, but as a hackathon project demo, we can choose this time-lapse for eclipses information. 


**c-Game:** 

The learner has to use the gained knowledge about Eclipses to save a lost astronaut and help him come back home based on his score, in the teaser, you can see a young learner whispering "I can answer these questions, I can save the astronaut".

**d-Multi-perspective simulation:**

The learner can choose the perspective they want, from Earth, the moon the sun, or any other solar system planet. 
First, we have provided a video on how to use the simulator to let learners set their creativity free choosing different perspectives.
